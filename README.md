# Comp_Srch Beta: Compound ID Search Web App (Prototype)

Welcome to the **Prototype** of **Comp_Srch**, a streamlined chemical compound search tool that lets you:

-  Search compounds by name
-  Get IDs: **PubChem, KEGG, HMDB, CAS**
-  View molecular structures (PubChem-based)- other plant libraries need to be added
-  Download batch results as CSV (need to add excel support)
-  See suggested KEGG pathways for available compounds
-  View processing insights (accuracy, match info stats)
-  Status check for the sites
